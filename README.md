<h1>Team 4692's own SwerveBase</h1>


#### <p>This program, along with the <a href="https://github.com/tlsd-robotics/Common-Library">Common Library</a>, will serve the role of being an ever growing and adapting template for making a SwerveDrive robot. It will have built in Path Planner autonomous support and with the help of the Limelight class, it will have target tracking too.</p>

<p>To create a solid foundation to build upon, this program uses <a href="https://github.com/democat3457/swerve-lib">Democat's fork of SDS SwerveLib</a>. Some modifications and structral changes were inpired by <a href="https://github.com/FRCTeam2910/2022CompetitionRobot">Team 2910 - Jack in The Bot's 2022 Code Release</a>.
